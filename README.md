This is an exapmle of some of my previous Python 3 learning and work. I have not shown everything on example as it would be deamed too simple and some of my other work I haven't recieved permission to share. The Alien Invasion files and Data Representation, Visulisation and API's files have been studied and made with the assistance of a book. The DDAT work is completely my own work that was undertaken as an ETL on the Government Digital Services DDAT job roles and skills framework, which initailly started of by using the api and geting the information from the API however after numerous atttempts the code is wokring resonablly well but still has some minor bugs. I then was able to find CSV files outlining the framework and was able to manipulate the information into the format wanted by the client.
